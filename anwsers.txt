How do you know?: As this one was the only one remaining.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Using the random number text files, I tested the times to see that Sort 2 was doing well for the most part. With numbers generated randomly, selection sort and bubble sort take 
a longer time than merge sort, which leads me to believe that sort1 uses Merge Sort 

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: When testing the reversed files, the selection sort would be quicker and more efficient due to the process of the algorithim trying to find the lowest value and replacing it 
with the first. Since the lowest value would be at the end and the greatest value would be at the beginning, meanign the 2 values would be at the correct spot with only 1 step. With bubble sort, the values at the beginning would not stop and continue to go 
to the end, putting them in the right spot. ONly 1 value would be at the right spot in 1 step, causing the bubble sort to have the lower time. Since sort 3 had the lower time, I am thinking that sort 3 uses 
selection sort.
